Design a comprehensive, interactive Lead Intelligence Dashboard for executives that fuses playful modern aesthetics with serious business utility. The dashboard should function as the strategic nerve center for leaders to understand, prioritize, and act on high-value leads, transforming decision-making into an elegant, AI-guided process. Lead Commander is not just a tool—it's a co-pilot, arming users with real-time insights, intelligent sorting, and operational clarity from the moment they log in.

Design Philosophy

Create a dashboard that is:

Modern yet intelligent: A sleek interface that feels futuristic but intuitive, serious but never sterile.
Data-rich, yet inviting: Use elegant data visualizations that invite interaction, spark curiosity, and feel almost game-like in their dynamism.
Hyper-personalized: Every executive sees what matters to them—automatically.
Uncluttered: Maximum insight with minimal clicks. Every pixel has a purpose.
Cross-platform: Fully optimized across devices, so the command center is always within reach.
